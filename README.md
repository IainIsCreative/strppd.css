strppd.css
==========
A CSS reset based on the classic Meyer reset. Included are extra resets for mobiles as well as interactive element settings, and typographical styling.

Feel free to use this code as you wish, and by all means, if you feel something is missing, please, download, fork and commit the code to help improve this reset and make it easier for developers to have complete control over browser styling.

Have fun! :-)
